        | Docker Image Scan | ✅ Moved to test.yml workflow |
        
        ## Next Steps
        - Review any failed scans in the workflow logs
        - Check uploaded SARIF files for detailed vulnerability information
        - Docker image security scanning results are available in the test.yml workflow
        
        ## Security Artifacts
        Security scan results are uploaded as workflow artifacts and available for download.
        Docker image scan results are available in the test.yml workflow artifacts.
